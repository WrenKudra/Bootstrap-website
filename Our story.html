          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Elula Naturals began after my husband had a health scare and needed
            to use natural, chemical-free products (and a friend who inspired me
            to tackle the dream of my own brand), and to make these products
            available to others in a similar situation. We started with crochet
            cotton face cloths and soap bars. With each request or need, it has
            been "back to the lab" (in my case, the kitchen) to research recipes
            and formulate a product that smells good and feels good to use. My
            family and friends are constantly being harassed to test a cream,
            balm, or soap...or being labelled the "guinea pig", testing out
            something new to add to our range. It has been a wonderful journey
            so far, with our range growing steadily, which now includes gifting
            and products for men. <br /><br />
            We are passionate about supporting local and finding the finest
            ingredients for our products. We support local farmers where we can.
            Our honey comes from ethnically harvested, sustainably managed
            hives. Our essential oils are 100% pure and locally grown, ensuring
            the purest ingredients are used in our products.
            <br /><br />
            We create products with gentle, nourishing ingredients based on
            simple, honest principles. No animals were harmed to make or test
            our products. Our products are biodegradable, non-toxic and suitable
            for all skin types. Everything we make is 100% natural and does not
            contain artificial fragrances, parabens, petrochemicals or
            endocrine-disrupting substances.
